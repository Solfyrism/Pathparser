    Given a required total food amount and a dictionary mapping resource names to
    available amounts, return a dictionary showing how much of each resource should be consumed.

    No single resource may contribute more than 50% (i.e. required/2), but each resource should
    ideally contribute at least 15% of the required amount if possible.

    The algorithm will always use the most abundant resource (up to the cap)
    and then distribute the remaining requirement among the other resources
    proportionally to their available amounts (each capped at required/2).

    Parameters:
      required: int -- The total food units needed.
      available: dict -- Keys are resource names (e.g. 'meat', 'fish', etc.),
                         and values are the available amounts.
